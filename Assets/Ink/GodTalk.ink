Hi Greeny

//Greeny
Where am I?

//God
You are in my shrine.

//Greeny
What am I doing here?

//God
You are here to quench my infinite thirst for love by fetching me bunny hearts.

//Greeny
...

//God
Your time is limited. When time is up you have to be back in my shrine.

//Greeny
I guess I have no choice. Where do I get the bunnies?
