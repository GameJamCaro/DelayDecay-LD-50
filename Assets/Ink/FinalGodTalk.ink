//God
Give me the bunnies!

//Greeny
You will never become adorable if you remain so cruel!

//God
You know nothing, you're just a greeny, Greeny!

//greeny
I might be a greeny, but I know that your demands are in vain.

//God
But you are stopping decay, if you do as I say.

//greeny
Decay is inevitable. So you can only delay decay.

//God
Hm, and what am I supposed to do instead?

//greeny
Just take it easy!

//God
Hm, Maybe you're right :)
